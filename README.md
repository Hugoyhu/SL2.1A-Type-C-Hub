# SL2.1A Type-C Hub
A simple 4-port USB2 hub based on the SL2.1A design.
This board is designed in KiCAD v7! It is based off an earlier [2021 design](https://github.com/Hugoyhu/Hack-Club-Zephyr-USB-Hub) with USB-A outputs. 

This revises the board to provide USB2 Type-C outputs. By default, the schematic provides circuitry for default USB power (500mA) but resistor values can be changed to provide higher output current if available through external power.
